## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Used CSS Grid for the body as well the testimonial section and placed each testimonial articles in their specific grids according to the responsive layouts. I didn't use grid-template-areas for this solution but that is another fun way to implement grids for responsive layouts which I'll explore in the upcoming challenges.

### Continued development

I'd continue to polish my css grid skills along with css flexbox for designing the perfect layouts.
